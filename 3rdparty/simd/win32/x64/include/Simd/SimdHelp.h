    The <b>%Simd Library</b> is a free open source image processing library, designed for C and C++ programmers.
    It provides many useful high performance algorithms for image processing such as: pixel format conversion, image scaling and filtration, 
    extraction of statistic information from images, motion detection.
    
    \n\n The algorithms are optimized with using of different SIMD CPU extensions. 
    In particular the library supports following CPU extensions: SSE, SSE2, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX and AVX2 for x86/x64, VMX(Altivec) and VSX(Power7) for PowerPC.

    \n\n The %Simd Library has C API and also contains useful C++ classes and functions to facilitate access to C API.
    The library supports dynamic and static linking, 32-bit and 64-bit Windows and Linux, MSVS and G++ compilers, MSVS project and CMake build systems.

    \section s1 Library folder's structure

    The %Simd Library has next folder's structure:
     - \c simd/src/Simd/ - contains source codes of the library.
     - \c simd/src/Test/ - contains test framework of the library.
     - \c simd/prj/vs11/ - contains project files of Microsoft Visual Studio 2012.
     - \c simd/prj/cmd/ - contains additional scripts needed for building of the library in Windows.
     - \c simd/prj/cmake/ - contains files of CMake build systems.
     - \c simd/prj/sh/ - contains additional scripts needed for building of the library in Linux.
     - \c simd/prj/txt/ - contains text files needed for building of the library.
     - \c simd/doc/ - contains documentation of the library.
     - \c simd/doc/src/ - contains scripts for generation of this documentation by <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">doxygen</a>.

     \section s2 The library using

     If you use the library from C code you must include:
     \code
     #include "Simd/Simd.h"
     \endcode

     And to use the library from C++ code you must include:
     \code
     #include "Simd/Simd.hpp"
     \endcode

     \section s3 Test Framework

     The test suite is needed for testing of correctness of work of the library and also for performance testing of the library.
